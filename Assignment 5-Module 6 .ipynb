{"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0,"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyMg9FSTzhdi2Dz6XZC3UMbd"},"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Files, exceptional handling,\n","logging and memory\n","management"],"metadata":{"id":"6BefW-7icxIx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n","  - Interpreted languages run code line by line, making them slower but easier to test (e.g., Python, JavaScript).Compiled languages convert code into machine language before running, making them faster but requiring compilation first (e.g., C, C++).Each has different uses.\n","\n","2. What is exception handling in Python?\n","  - Exception handling in Python manages errors during program execution using `try`,`except`,`finally`, and `raise`.It prevents crashes by catching errors and handling them properly.For example,if dividing by zero,Python shows a custom message instead of stopping the program.\n","\n","3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n","    - The`finally`block in Python runs no matter what,whether an error occurs or not.It is used for cleanup tasks like closing files or releasing resources. This ensures important code runs even if an exception happens in the`try`block.\n","\n","4.  What is logging in Python?\n","    - Logging in Python records messages about a program’s execution, helping track errors and events.Using the `logging` module,you can save messages to a file or display them on the screen.It helps debug and monitor applications without stopping them.\n","\n","5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","    - The`__del__` method in Python is a special function that runs when an object is deleted. It is used for cleanup tasks like closing files or freeing memory.However,relying on it isn’t recommended because garbage collection handles most cleanup automatically.\n","\n","6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n","    - `import module` loads the whole module, requiring the module name to access functions(e.g., `math.sqrt(16)`). `from module import function` imports specific functions directly,so you can use them without the module name(e.g., `sqrt(16)`).The first avoids conflicts.\n","\n","7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n","    - In Python, you can handle multiple exceptions using multiple except blocks or a single except with a tuple of exceptions. This prevents crashes and handles different errors properly. Example:\n","  try:  \n","    x = 1 / 0  \n","except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError):  \n","    print(\"Error occurred!\")  \n","\n","\n","8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n","    - The with statement in Python is used for handling files safely. It automatically opens and closes files, even if an error occurs. This prevents memory leaks and makes code cleaner. Example:\n","    with open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as f:  \n","    data = f.read()  \n","\n","9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n","    - Multithreading runs multiple tasks (threads) within the same program, sharing memory, making it efficient for I/O tasks. Multiprocessing runs separate processes with independent memory, making it better for CPU-intensive tasks. Threads are lightweight, while processes are heavier but more powerful.\n","\n","10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n","    - Logging helps track errors,events,and program flow without stopping execution. It improves debugging, monitors performance,and saves important information for later analysis.With different log levels (info, warning, error),it makes troubleshooting easier and helps maintain reliable applications.\n","\n","11. What is memory management in Python?\n","    - Memory management in Python automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation using a built-in garbage collector.It frees unused memory to prevent leaks.Python uses dynamic memory allocation,so developers don’t need to manually manage memory like in some other languages.\n","\n","12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n","    - Exception handling in Python involves:  \n","      1. Try: Code that may cause an error is placed inside a`try`block.  \n","      2. Except: Catches and handles specific or general errors.  \n","      3. Finally: Runs cleanup code, whether an error occurs or not.\n","\n","13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n","    - Memory management in Python is important to optimize performance and prevent memory leaks.It automatically allocates and frees memory using garbage collection, ensuring efficient resource use.This helps programs run smoothly without wasting memory or causing crashes due to excessive usage.\n","\n","14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n","    - In Python,the `try` block contains code that might cause an error. The `except` block catches and handles the error, preventing the program from crashing. This helps in managing unexpected issues smoothly and allows the program to continue running.\n","\n","15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n","    - Python’s garbage collection automatically frees unused memory to prevent leaks.It uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to remove objects no longer needed. This keeps memory usage efficient,so developers don’t have to manually manage memory allocation and deallocation.\n","\n","16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n","    - In Python, the `else` block in exception handling runs only if no exceptions occur in the `try` block. It is used for code that should execute when there are no errors,keeping the `try` block focused on risky operations.\n","\n","17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n","    - Python has five common logging levels:  \n","\n","1. DEBUG – Detailed information for debugging.  \n","2. INFO – General program updates.  \n","3. WARNING– Something might be wrong.  \n","4. ERROR – A problem occurred.  \n","5. CRITICAL – A serious error that needs immediate attention.\n","\n","18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n","    - os.fork() creates a child process by directly duplicating the current process, working only on Unix systems. The multiprocessing module works on all platforms,creating independent processes with better control and communication,making it a safer and more portable choice.\n","\n","19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n","    - Closing a file in Python frees system resources and ensures data is properly saved.If a file isn’t closed,it may cause memory leaks or data corruption.Using file.close() or the with statement helps prevent these issues and keeps programs efficient.\n","\n","20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n","    - file.read() reads the entire file as a single string,while file.readline() reads only one line at a time. read() is useful for processing full content,while readline() is better for handling files line by line efficiently.\n","\n","21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n","    - The logging module in Python records important events,errors,and debugging messages during program execution. It helps track issues, monitor performance,and save logs to files or display them on the screen,making troubleshooting and maintaining programs easier.\n","\n","22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n","    - The os module in Python helps with file handling by allowing operations like creating,deleting,renaming, and checking files or directories.It also helps navigate file paths,making it useful for managing files and folders in a program.\n","\n","23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n","    - Challenges in Python’s memory management include high memory usage due to dynamic typing,garbage collection delays,and memory leaks from unused object references.Managing large data structures efficiently and avoiding circular references can also be tricky,affecting performance and resource usage.\n","\n","24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n","    - Multithreading is important for applications needing faster execution and responsiveness,like web servers or GUI programs.It allows multiple tasks to run simultaneously,improving performance for I/O-bound tasks,such as downloading files or handling user inputs, without blocking the program.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ZnFJ9cmT8a7i"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"R2oKAoS9L5kJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
